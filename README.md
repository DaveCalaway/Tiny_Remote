# Tiny_Remote  
ATtiny85 IR Library, you can send the IR Signal with the Pysical pin 3 - aka 4 - .   
   
This library is a mix of library and code from those components:
  - Arduino-IRremote: https://goo.gl/WJ6zLu
  - "tiny_IRremote" Arduino IRremote ported to the ATtiny: https://goo.gl/cAxs1T

I recommend you to use the ATTinyCore for driver the ATtiny85: https://goo.gl/hin2re
